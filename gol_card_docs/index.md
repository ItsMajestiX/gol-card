The following is a brief explanation of what documents can be found in this folder.

The daily folder, despite its name, does not contain daily updates. Instead, larger updates are given roughly every week. These go over my thoughts as I was working on the software portion of the project, ending in February 2025.

# [[Zig]]
An overview of Zig, the language this project is written in.

# [[Project Outline]]

# [[Early Planning Note]]
This file is another Obsidian note I had in a different folder working out ideas for a project like this.
