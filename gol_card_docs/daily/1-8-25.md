Quick note for myself on implementing the CRC so I don't forget.

TI's manual says that the CRC module is 16 bits and uses the CRC-CCITT-BR implementation. Looking through Zig's standard library, I didn't find one by that name. I check the source for the file, which pointed me to a script that generated that file. That script got its information from a text file, which had a note at the top leading to [this website](https://reveng.sourceforge.io/crc-catalogue/all.htm). This page does mention the algorithm, and gives two versions for MSB first (CRC-16/XMODEM) and LSB (CRC-16/KERMIT) first, both of which TI's implementation supports. However, the example given in the manual points toward another algorithm (CRC-16/MCRF4XX) which is the same as KERMIT execept for the seed (0xFFFF vs 0x0000).

Another note for myself: the rationale for the new HAL redesign is based on cache misses being very rare for both the update code and the SPI interrupt (6.9 in the manual)
